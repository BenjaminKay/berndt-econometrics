®PT2¯NOTES REGARDING THE DATA IN SUBDIRECTORY "CHAP2.DAT":

I.  The following data files in the subdirectory CHAP2.DAT each contain
monthly return data for 120 observations during the period January
1978 through December 1987 (see text chapter 2 for full company names):

    MOBIL  TEXACO   IBM    DEC  DATGEN   CONED    PSNH  WEYER  BOISE
    MOTOR  TANDY  PANAM  DELTA  CONTIL  CITCRP  GERBER  GENMIL

In addition, there is a monthly return data series for the market as a
whole, called MARKET, and for the 30-day US Treasury Bill - a riskfree 
asset called RKFREE.  For both MARKET and RKFREE, there are 120 monthly
observations covering the January 1978 thru December 1987 time period.

However, there are several data series and data files that cover 
different time periods:

    CONOCO, a data series in the EVENTS data file, has monthly returns
        data covering only the January 1976 through September 1981 
        time period (when it was taken over by DuPont).  Hence it has 
        only 69 observations.  More information on EVENTS is found 
        below.

    APM, which has a number of data files covering the December
        1977 thru December 1987 time period (121 observations).
        More information on APM is found below.

    EVENTS, which covers January 1976 through December 1985.  More
        information on EVENTS and its data files is found below.

    GOLD, which covers January 1976 through December 1985.  More
        information on GOLD and its data files is found below.

All other files have 120 observations.

II. Each data file giving returns represents the monthly return on a
    financial asset (common stocks, as well as a MARKET index, a 
    "riskfree" (30-day T-bills) series called RKFREE, and the GOLD
    mineral), and has the following format:

        The first line indicates the name of the company whose return
            is found in that file, and the time period.  YOU MAY NEED
            TO EDIT THIS LINE WITH AN EDITOR OR WORD PROCESSOR TO 
            MATCH THE NEEDS OF YOUR STATISTICAL SOFTWARE.  SEE SECTION
            1.2 OF CHAPTER 1 IN THE TEXT FOR FURTHER DETAILS.
         
        The next 120 lines (except as noted above, when the number of
            observations differs from 120) give monthly returns for
            the company or asset named in the first line, including
            any dividends paid, as in equation (2.1) in the text.  
            Note that the return is a monthly one in monthly rates, 
            i.e. it is not an annualized return.

III.  The APM file contains supplementary data for use in running a
    regression based on Ross' Arbitrage Pricing Model.  The variables
    in this file cover December 1977 through December 1987, and
    therefore each include 121 observations.  The variables are:

        POIL       ($)  Nominal price per barrel of domestic crude oil,
                   Domestic First Purchase Price
        FRBIND     Federal Reserve Board index of industrial production,
                   1972=100, Total Industry Industry Production, series
                   is seasonally adjusted
        CPI        Consumer Price Index, All Items (1967=100)

The source of the data series for FRBIND and CPI is various annual
    reports of the Economic Report of the President, Washington, DC:
    US Government Printing Office.  For POIL, the data source is the
    Monthly Energy Review published by the US Department of Energy,
    various July issues.

IV. The datafile named EVENTS contains data over the January 1976 - December
    1985 (not January 1978 - December 1987) time period.  Data series on
    monthly returns are from the CRSP source noted above.  There are 120
    monthly observations.  Variables in EVENTS are:

        DATE       YYMM - The date -- the first two digits are the year
                   (e.g., 1978 is 78) and the next two digits are the
                   month (January is 01, December is 12)
        GPU        General Public Utilities
        DOW        Dow Chemical Company
        DUPONT     E. I. DuPont Company
        MARK76     The CRSP overall market rate of return, which
                   differs from MARKET only in the time interval --
                   MARK76 is 1/76 thru 12/85, while MARKET is 1/78
                   thru 12/87.
        RKFR76     The riskfree 30-day rate of return on US Treasury
                   Bills, which differs from MARKET only in the time
                   interval - RKFR76 is 1/76 thru 12/85, while RKFREE
                   is 1/78 thru 12/87.

    Two other data series in this file contains only 69 observations, 
    from 1/76 through 9/81.  They are DATE1 and CONOCO:

        DATE1      Just as in DATE above, but having only 69 observa-
                   tions from 1/76 thru 9/81
        CONOCO     Conoco (only 69 observations - 1/76 thru 9/81

V.  Finally, the data file called GOLD contains three data series, all
    covering the January 1976 thru December 1985 time period.  All 
    series in this data file have 120 observations.  The data series in
    the GOLD data file include:

        GOLD       The percent change in the price of gold over the month
        MARK76     The CRSP overall market rate of return - see description
                   in the EVENTS data file discussed above
        RKFR76     The riskfree 30-day monthly rate of return on US Treasury
                   bills -- see description in the EVENTS data file discussed
                   above

    The source of the GOLD data is various issues of the Wall Street Journal.
