THIS DATA SET CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING VARIABLES:

DEVICE    = Computer Model Number
FCS       = Year of First Customer Shipment
CAP       = Capacity, in Megabtyes
ACT       = Number of Actuators (read/write heads) on the Device
ACCT      = Average Access Time in Milliseconds
ROTD      = Average Rotation Delay in Milliseconds
TR        = Transfer Rate in Kilobytes per Second
ARDEN     = Areal Density in Kilobits per Squared Inch
PRICE     = Price in Nominal Dollars
SPEED     = ACT/(ACCT + ROTD + (2000/TR))

OLDTR     = Old data series for TR (see note below)
OLDARD    = Old data series for ARDEN (see note below)
OLDPR     = Old data series for PRICE (see note below)
OLDSP     = Old data series for SPEED (see note below)
DUM72 to DUM84 = Year-specific dummy variables for observation year

Note:  The original data used by Cole et al. in the regression results reported in Chapter 4 contained several data errors.  These errors have been corrected in the above data series.  However, in order to replicate the reported Cole results, the original data (with errors included) need to be used.  In the second set of 91 lines, there first appear the data series for TR, ARDEN, PRICE and SPEED with errors included; these variables are named OLDTR, OLDARD, OLDPR and OLDSP.  



Variable Names: 

   For first 91 lines: DEVICE YEAR FCS CAP ACT ACCT ROTD TR ARDEN PRICE SPEED
   Then a blank line:
   For second 91 lines: OLDTR OLDARD OLDPR OLDSP D72 D73 D74 D75 D76 D77 D78
                        D79 D80 D81 D82 D83 D84

           quotation in the Farmers' Produce Market Report for the Massa-
           chusetts Dept. of Agriculture for the day on which each lot was
           sold 
GREEN    = Number of inches of gren color on the asparagus, in hundredths
           of inches
NOSTALKS = Number of stalks of asparagus per bunch 
DISPERSE = Variation in the size of the stalks -- the interquartile
           coefficient
