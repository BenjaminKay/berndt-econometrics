        DATA DISKETTE TO CORRESPOND WITH ERNST R. BERNDT,
                 THE PRACTICE OF ECONOMETRICS

This data diskette is written in ASCII format, and contains information
and data on a number of data series.  The format is as follows.

The data and corresponding data information is stored in a sub-directory
entitled CHAPx.DAT for chapters x = 2 through 11.  Within each chapter sub-directory, there is a README.DOC file which should be read prior to using
the data files.  In particular, the README.DOC file in each subdirectory
CHAPx.DAT contains information on data file names, units of measurement, 
data sources, etc. for chapter x in the text.

In the root directory, there are two files.  This README.DOC file which you
are now reading, and a data file called COLORTV, reproduced from Table 1.1 
in the text.  The three variables in COLORTV are YEAR, PRICE (for price
index), and CUMPROD (cumulative production, in millions).

In order to copy this diskette, use the DOS command XCOPY /S, available on 
DOS 3.2 and later versions.  Do not use the more common COPY command, for 
the data diskette contains sub-directories, and COPY does not copy sub-
directories intact, whereas the XCOPY /S command does.  Alternatively, you
can use the DISKCOPY command, which reproduces the entire diskette, but 
this command is time-consuming and cumbersome.  For further information on
copying files, subdirectories and diskettes, see your DOS manual.
