THE MROZ DATA FILE IS TAKEN FROM THE 1976 PANEL STUDY OF INCOME DYNAMICS, AND IS BASED ON DATA FOR THE PREVIOUS YEAR, 1975.  OF THE 753 OBSERVATIONS, THE FIRST 428 ARE FOR WOMEN WITH POSITIVE HOURS WORKED IN 1975, WHILE THE REMAINING 325 OBSERVATIONS ARE FOR WOMEN WHO DID NOT WORK FOR PAY IN 1975.  A MORE COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF THE DATA IS FOUND IN MROZ [1987], APPENDIX 1. THE DATA SET CONSISTS OF 753 OBSERVATIONS ON 19 VARIABLES:

8.  RPWG  Wife's wage reported at the time of the 1976 interview (not the same as the 1975 estimated wage).
