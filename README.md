# berndt-econometrics
<h1> Introduction </h1>
This repository contains the data files for textbook *The Practice of Econometrics (Classic and Contemporary)* by [Ernst R. Berndt][2]. [The Practice of Econometrics][1] was published in 1991 and has ISBN 0-201-49900-2. Currently the repository contains the raw data files from the floppy disk that accompanies the text. 

If I get around to it I may do the exercises in a more modern language. 


<h1>Other resources</h1>
The completed exercises and data files using TSP for The Practice of Econometrics is available from [Clint Cummin's website][3]. However, given that TSP is rarely used any longer, this repository allows for non-TSP users to access the data necessary to complete the book's exercises.
